                <!-- This paragraph describes Alex's focus and background rooted in personal experience -->
                <p>I’m an educator and lifelong learner focused on creating and scaling programs that bring about real community change. My work is rooted in my early experiences in West Philadelphia public schools, where I saw firsthand what happens when teachers and students are asked to do more with far too little. That experience shaped my commitment to making learning more accessible and centered on people.</p>
                <!-- This paragraph details Alex's diverse work experience across multiple sectors -->
                <p>Over the past decade, I’ve worked across public education, tech, philanthropy, and nonprofit leadership — teaching in Title I classrooms, designing programs grounded in creativity and connection, and more recently experimenting with building AI models and roadmaps to help accelerate impact.</p>
                <!-- This paragraph explains the core belief in human connection that drives Alex's work -->
                <p>At the heart of everything I do is a belief in connection to ourselves, to each other, and to the communities we’re part of. When people are trusted, supported, and encouraged to lead, meaningful change follows. Education shouldn't just check boxes, but empower learners to see themselves as capable, creative, and able to make a difference.</p>
                <!-- This paragraph outlines the purpose of the site and Alex's personal interests -->
                <p>This site is where I share my work, ideas, and experiments around learning, technology, and social impact, along with the things that keep me grounded including movement, animals, and community.</p>
