                <h1>Hi, I'm Alex!</h1>
                <p>I’m a curriculum designer, educator, and community impact strategist focused on building learning experiences that prepare students to lead in a rapidly changing world. My passion is creating programs that are both accessible and future-oriented, existing at the intersection between community impact and technology.</p>
                <p>My background spans public education, tech, philanthropy, and nonprofit leadership. I’ve developed national expansion strategies for education initiatives rooted in community change, built tech courses for an international startup, and designed programs that center equity while helping students build 21st-century skills. I’ve worked in classrooms, with multilingual learners and students with IEPs, and behind the scenes developing systems that scale across communities and reach learners from all backgrounds.</p>
                <p>What drives all of this is a core belief: students are capable of extraordinary things when we give them the tools, trust, and space to lead. Education should do more than check boxes – it should challenge, empower, and invite young people to see themselves as changemakers. My work sits at the crossroads of education and innovation, helping students build the skills they need for the future while staying grounded in the communities they’re part of.</p>
                <p>This site is a place to share some of my shower thoughts, resources, and ideas for what’s next!</p>
